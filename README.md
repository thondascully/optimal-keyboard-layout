Known: At WPM exceeding 120ish (rough guess), typing speed is negatively impacted by words whose physical keys on the keyboard are typed by the same finger.

In comparison, words whose sets of neighbors (sets of two letters) are typed by different fingers are much faster to execute.

> Try it yourself! Type `beacon` and then type `reviewers`. As you can probably tell, `beacon` is much easier to type than `reviewers` because of the diversity in finger usage (and consistent hand swapping).
