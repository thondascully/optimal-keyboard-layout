**Prints out the keyboard layout in which every key is as far away from its most common neighbor throughout the top 2000 words in the English language**
> **`"hello"` -> `h` and `e` are neighbors**

**This specific layout is customized for my specific hand positioning while typing.**

> Notation: `L` signifies `Left hand`. `R` signifies `Right hand`. `1..5` signifies fingers, where `1` is thumb and `5` is pinky. Therefore, from left to right, the order of fingers is `L5`, `L4`, `L3`, `L2`, `L1`, `R1`, `R2`, `R3`, `R4`, `R5`.

Known: At WPM exceeding 120ish (rough guess), typing speed is negatively impacted by words whose physical keys on the keyboard are typed by the same finger.

In comparison, words whose sets of neighbors (sets of two letters) are typed by different fingers are much faster to execute.

**Try it yourself! Type `beacon` and then type `reviewers`. As you can probably tell, `beacon` is much easier to type than `reviewers` because of the diversity in finger usage (and consistent hand swapping).**

> For me, `beacon` is typed as follows: `R2`, `L3`, `L4`, `L2`, `R3`, `R2`. It should be noted that `R2` repeats once, but only after 5 other key registers. This is enough time for it to feel comfortable.

> For me, `reviewers` is typed as follows: `L2`, `L3`, `L2`, `R3`, `L3`, `L3`, `L3`, `L2`, `L3`. It should be noted that `L3` repeats 5 times, with 4 of them being within a 5 key register time span. This is uncomfortable!

Disclaimer: words such as `reviewers` are hard on _my_ hand positioning layout. This is not universal. Unfortunately, this program is created with _my_ hand layout in mind, **so it might not be tailored for you as a reader**.
